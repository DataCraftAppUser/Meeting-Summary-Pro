# Frontend Installation Instructions

## Run this command:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Badlb\OneDrive\Cursor\Meeting-Summary-Pro\frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This will install all dependencies while ignoring the TypeScript version conflict between react-scripts and TypeScript 5.x.

The installation may take a few minutes. Once it's complete, you should see:
- ✅ `node_modules` folder created
- ✅ No errors in the output

After installation, you can start the frontend with:
```powershell
npm start
```
